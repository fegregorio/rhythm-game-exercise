# ROBODANS (Working title)

As the shell of a grid-based rhythm game, ROBODANS was intended to serve
as a practical Unity exercise. Though it already served its purpose, this
project might be further developed down the line as I study and get more
familiarized with Unity.

Description: ROBODANS is a grid-based bullet catcher rhythm game. Dance
your way to success as you catch circuits and evade bombs with finesse.
Different objects will be thrown on the field to the beat of the music.
